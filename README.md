MovieMind 


This is a Content-Based Movie Recommendation System Flask app 
The "MovieMind" project utilizes Flask, MySQL, and Python to create a personalized movie recommendation system based on user preferences. Users can easily search for movies, view details, and receive tailored recommendations using content-based filtering. By integrating the TMDb API, users gain access to additional information like movie posters, cast, and other metadata. The system enables users to explore similar movies. The content-based recommendation engine uses cosine similarity to suggest movies with similar features, enhancing user engagement and satisfaction. The backend handles user authentication, data storage, and movie recommendations, ensuring a smooth user experience.

Furthermore, this system ensures data security by keeping user information secure within a MySQL database, while Flask handles the server-side operations efficiently. The integration of the TMDb API enhances the user experience by providing detailed movie information, and the use of machine learning algorithms helps deliver accurate and personalized recommendations.
